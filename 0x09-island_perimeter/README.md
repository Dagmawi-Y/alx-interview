# Island Perimeter

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of an island represented by a grid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE

## Usage

To calculate the perimeter of an island, run the `island_perimeter.py` script with a grid input.

```python
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 0]
]

print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output should be 16
```
